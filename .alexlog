 Sun Feb 23 21:14:27 2014: Added spec. and placeholder for readBoardFile.
 Sun Feb 23 21:26:11 2014: Changed specification and name of readBoardFile.
To better represent what the function does, function name was changed in
specification to readBoardsFile, and corrected to this in function placeholder.

To better describe what a board file is, the parameter name was changed to
boardsFile, file extention was changed from .board to .boards to represent that
a boards file can contain several boards.

 Sun Feb 23 22:11:41 2014: Added function readNumbersFromLine
 Sun Feb 23 22:56:15 2014: Smaller changes to specification of readBoardFromLine
 Sun Feb 23 22:58:01 2014: Started specification of readBoard.
 Sun Feb 23 23:19:31 2014: Changed impl. and spec. of readNumbersFromLine.
As hexadecimal sudoku will use 0-F, and others may use any symbols, better use
'a option as return value. Using int option at the moment for simplicity, but
implementation could be changed to take a list of symbols (or let a higher
function "guess" symbols) as indata or simply return a list of chars or strings.

 Mon Feb 24 15:19:54 2014: Fixed bug of 3x3 boxes in blockposToIndex.

square root of boardside length.

 Mon Feb 24 16:07:27 2014: Added boxSide and xyToBlock.
 Mon Feb 24 19:10:46 2014: Merge branch 'master' into fubar
