exception MalformattedBoard

(* REPRESENTATION CONVENTION:
    Let b = Board(n,v).
    n stands for the length of the side of a box in the sudoku.
    This means that for
    - a normal 9x9,  n = 3
    - a        16x16,n = 4
    - a        4x4,  n = 2
    and so on. In general the side of a box is the root of the
    side of the board. This means that only boards with sides
    of length n*n is allowed where n is a positive integer.

    v is a vector of length n^4, or boardside^2 where
    boardside = n^2. For brevity and clarity, let us
    write Vector.sub(w,i+j*n*n) as w(i,j).
    v(i,j) represents a set of non-excluded values
    for the cell (i,j) in the sudoku
    (using indexes starting at zero) as a list of the
    non-excluded values.

    If v(i,j) = [k] the cell is considered to be set.
    k is said to be an impossibility at (i,j) if
      putting k at (i,j) makes the board impossible
      to solve.

    A board B' = Board (n',v') is said to extend B
    if v'(i,j) is a subset or equal to v(i,j).

   REPRESENTATION INVARIANT:

    Example of boxes in a 4x4 sudoku:
    12|34
    34|12
    -- --
    23|41
    41|23

    v(i,j) is a subset of {1,...,n*n}
    v(i,j) is not empty

    If (a,b) \neq (i,j), v(a,b) = [k] and one
    of the below holds then k \notin v(i,j).
    - (i,j) is in the same box as (a,b)
    - a = i
    - b = j
